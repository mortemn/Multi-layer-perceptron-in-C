# Multi-layer Perceptron from Scratch in C

## Introduction

This is a basic multi-layer perceptron trained on the MNIST dataset for image classification that follows Michael Nielsen's book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning". It is written with C using only standard libraries. I kept the implementation very minimal, using normal distribution sampling for weight and bias initialisation and backpropogation with stochastic gradient descent for optimisation.
